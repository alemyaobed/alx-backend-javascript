# 0x04. TypeScript


## Description
This project focuses on learning TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of basic types in TypeScript, working with interfaces, classes, and functions, manipulating the DOM with TypeScript, using generic types, working with namespaces, merging declarations, importing external libraries using ambient namespaces, and implementing basic nominal typing with TypeScript.

- Basic types in TypeScript
- Interfaces, classes, and functions in TypeScript
- Working with the DOM and TypeScript
- Generic types in TypeScript
- Using namespaces in TypeScript
- Merging declarations in TypeScript
- Importing external libraries using ambient namespaces in TypeScript
- Basic nominal typing with TypeScript


## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
